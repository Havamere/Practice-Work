//	1. Computer picks randomly generated number between 1 and 1000
//	2. User enters a number (checked between 1-1000)(checked if real/positive number)
//	3. Computer relays back how close user imput is to generated number(cold, cool, warm, hot, BINGO!)
//	4. Cold = >500; Cool = <500 and >100; Warm = <100 and >50; Hot = <50 and >1; BINGO! = correct number
//	5. Log to user last 10 guesses with cold/cool/warm/hot rating.
